Query: Your container doesn't have GPU drivers installed. So how does PyTorch inside it use the host's GPU?

This confused me for a while. Here's what's actually happening:

When PyTorch runs a CUDA operation, it doesn't talk to the GPU directly.
It goes through the CUDA Runtime → CUDA Driver → /dev/nvidia0 device file → Linux Kernel → actual GPU hardware.

The driver lives on the host and the runtime lives in the container. So how do they connect?

🪄 The answer is OCI runtime hooks.

When containerd starts your container, the NVIDIA Container Toolkit intercepts the process at the prestart/createRuntime hook.
Before your app even starts, it:

- Mounts GPU device files (/dev/nvidia*)
- Injects NVIDIA driver libraries from the host
- Sets environment variables (NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES)
- Configures device cgroups

Your container image stays generic and the GPU capabilities get injected at runtime.

That's why you can use a standard nvidia/cuda base image and it "just works" — the toolkit adds everything needed at the last moment.
